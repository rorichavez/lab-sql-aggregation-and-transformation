#Challenge 1
-- You need to use SQL built-in functions to gain insights relating to the duration of movies:
-- 1.1 Determine the shortest and longest movie durations and name the values as max_duration and min_duration.

SELECT MAX(length) AS max_duration, MIN(length) AS min_duration
FROM film;

-- 1.2. Express the average movie duration in hours and minutes. Don't use decimals.
-- Hint: Look for floor and round functions.
SELECT FLOOR(AVG(length) / 60), -- Horas
        ' hours ',
        ROUND (AVG(length) % 60), -- Minutos
        ' minutes'
FROM film;

# 2.You need to gain insights related to rental dates:

-- 2.1 Calculate the number of days that the company has been operating.
-- Hint: To do this, use the rental table, and the DATEDIFF() function to subtract the earliest date in the rental_date column from the latest date.
SELECT 
DATEDIFF(MAX(return_date), MIN(rental_date))
FROM rental;

-- 2.2 Retrieve rental information and add two additional columns to show the month and weekday of the rental. Return 20 rows of results.
SELECT *,
MONTH(rental_date) AS rental_month, 
DAY(rental_date) AS rental_weekday
FROM rental
LIMIT 20; 

-- 2.3 Bonus: Retrieve rental information and add an additional column called DAY_TYPE with values 'weekend' or 'workday', depending on the day of the week.
-- Hint: use a conditional expression.
SELECT *, 
	CASE
		WHEN DAYOFWEEK(rental_date) IN (1, 7) THEN 'weekend'
		ELSE 'workday'
	END AS DAY_TYPE
FROM rental;

# 3. You need to ensure that customers can easily access information about the movie collection. 
-- To achieve this, retrieve the film titles and their rental duration.
-- If any rental duration value is NULL, replace it with the string 'Not Available'. 
-- Sort the results of the film title in ascending order.
-- Please note that even if there are currently no null values in the rental duration column, 
-- the query should still be written to handle such cases in the future.
-- Hint: Look for the IFNULL() function.

SELECT rental_duration
FROM film
WHERE rental_duration IS NULL;

SELECT title,  
		IFNULL(rental_duration, 'Not Available') AS rental_duration
FROM film 
ORDER BY title ASC;

# 4.BONUS
SELECT CONCAT (first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name,
	LEFT(email, 3) AS email_prefix
FROM customer
ORDER BY last_name ASC;

# Challenge 2
# Next, you need to analyze the films in the collection to gain some more insights. Using the film table, determine:
# 1.1 The total number of films that have been released.
SELECT COUNT(title) FROM film;

#Â 1.2 The number of films for each rating.
SELECT COUNT(title) AS title_count, rating
FROM film
GROUP BY rating;

# 1.3 The number of films for each rating, sorting the results in descending order of the number of films. 
#This will help you to better understand the popularity of different film ratings and adjust purchasing decisions accordingly.
SELECT COUNT(title) AS title_count, rating
FROM film
GROUP BY rating 
ORDER BY title_count DESC;

# 2.Using the film table, determine:
# 2.1 The mean film duration for each rating, and sort the results in descending order 
# of the mean duration. Round off the average lengths to two decimal places. 
# This will help identify popular movie lengths for each category.
SELECT FORMAT(AVG(length),2) AS mean_duration, rating
FROM film
GROUP BY rating
ORDER BY mean_duration DESC; 

# 2.2 Identify which ratings have a mean duration of over two hours in order to help select films 
# for customers who prefer longer movies.
SELECT FORMAT(AVG(length),2) AS mean_duration, rating
FROM film
GROUP BY rating
HAVING AVG(length) > 120
ORDER BY mean_duration DESC;

#Bonus: determine which last names are not repeated in the table actor.
SELECT last_name
FROM actor
GROUP BY last_name
HAVING COUNT(last_name) = 1;
